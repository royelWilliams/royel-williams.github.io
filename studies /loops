/**
*LOOP 
*
*
*WHAT IS A LOOP???
*Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.Conditions typically 
*return true or false .A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false .
*
*
*WHY ARE LOOPS IMPORTANT???
*JavaScript loops provide a quick and easy method of doing something repeatedly.
 They are used to repeat an action number of times without having to repeat the same line of code.
*
*
*BASIC FOR LOOPS
*
*when making a loop you want to focus on declaration. using a variable then following the basic stepts of 
* defining where the loop starts, where the loop stops, and if the loop will be itterating up or down and by what incriment 
*for(var i = 0 ; i <= 12;i++)=> going up 
* for(var i = 0 ; i <= 12;i--)=> going down 
*
*
*
*
*FOR IN LOOPS
*
* We tend to use for in loops when going through objects 
*
*when writing a for in loop you want to call the loop using for declare a variable have key in object 
* the key part can be changed if it is what you wish 
*const capitals = {
* a:"allu",
* b:"bee",
* c:"carmen"};
* for(var key in capitals){
* }
*
* THE WHILE LOOP 
* although it is not as common as the other loops the while loop is also used through Javascript 
*Use a while loop when asking for user input.They will alo continue exiting the block of code as long as the code is true 
* Use a while loop when the increment value is nonstandard.
*while(x<145){
* count ++ // make sure to incriment x so the the loop will eventually stop 
* }
* results to the loop going on and on until whatever the number x is happens to be greater than the number 145
