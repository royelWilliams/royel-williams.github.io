/**
*VARIABES:
*WHAT IS A VARIABLE??
*
*In JavaScript, a variable stores data that can be changed later on.Always declare JavaScript variables 
* with var,let, orconst.
*The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.The let and const keywords were added  * to JavaScript in 2015. 
*If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.
*
*VAR LET  CONST ???
*
*
* var, let and const are extremely important things to think about when coding as they are basically the 
* bread and butter of everything that is going to happen after they are declared 
* you must remember what each of them stands for and the limits that are set when using them in your code
*
*var 
* - can be redeclared with the same name 
* -can take a global or functional scope
* 
*  declaration & Assignment:
* when assigning using the var keyword remember that things can be assigned the same thing in and out of  * a global 
* scope which can cause confusion later because var does not serve as a block scoped variable 
*  assigning var:
* var age; //is the var variable being declared. this is simply when you add a keyword to the var * * * 
*   variable and 
* 
*
*
*   let
* - can't be redeclared 
* - can be reassigned 
* -must be initalized with a value
* -block scoped(variable can not be called outside of its block of code)
* declaration & Assignment:
* when assigning the let variable similarly to var you van simply define it without assigning it to a * *definate value.
* however let is different from the var keyword in the sende that it is blocked scoped meaning that it * *can not be accessed outside of a score that is not global
* for instance if you are using a let keyword inside of a function you will not be able to continue to *reach that keyword 
* if 
*
*
*
*const  * -can't be redeclared(const is short for constant so the numbers shouldnt change)
*
* -can't be reassigned (const shouldnt change)
* -can be modified but not initialized 
* -block scoped(variable can not be called outside its block of code)
*
*
*
*  // 1. declaration - when declaring a variable it is important to use of  the keywords var, let, or 
* const. 
*they are all good and useful, however each of them has their own little kink.
*
*  var myName;
*
*  
*   At the declaration phase, the variable myName is undefined because we have NOT initialized
*   it to anything- this also means if you call this undefined variable it will show an error that said * variable has not been initlized 
*   
*  console.log(myName); // prints => undefined
*
*  // 2. initialization or assignment //
*  myName = 'Sam';
*  console.log(myName); // prints => Sam
*
*  // 3. re-assignment - you can reassign a variable to say something different if needed although this * *is usually used when u use the var keyword 
*  when you use the const keyword what is written is more set in stone becasues it van not be * 
*    manipulated//
*  myName = 'Harry';
*  console.log(myName); // prints => Harry
* // NOTE: We can assign and re-assign anything to a variable - when doing this it can lead to other * 
*    issues in the code  //
* var myTime = "time";// this would be the original declaration and assignment 
*
* var myTime = 8;// re-assigning  time to equal a number  
*
*   var myTime = true;// re-assigning the number to equal a boolean 
*
* myTime = "somTHING"; // and re-assigning the boolean to equal a string again 
*
*This process can go on  and on when using the var keyword it is actually one of the easiest ways to 
* reassign a variable.
