*FUNCTIONS 
*
*WHAT IS A FUNCTION???
*
*In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.
* A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword.
*
*
*WHY ARE FUNCTIONS IMPORTANT???
*
*Functions enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task. Once a function is created, 
* the details of how it works can almost be forgotten about.
*
* A function is made with the basics of  about 5 - 7 simple parts 
*
*Function declaration  - by writing function you are making a declaration
*
*Function name - a name that has to do with the function
*
*argument / parameter - a name variable passed in to represent 
*the arguments that will be passed in later 
*
*Function body - the main code of the  function
*
* Return statement - ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function
*
*Call & arguments that will be passed in -  to call the name of the
* function and pass in values into the parameter 
*Example:
*
*function objectValues(object) {
*    //create a bin to push keys 
*   var arr = [];
*   // for in loop to go through the object 
* for(var key in object){
*    // push the key out of the object 
*   arr.push(object[key]);
*    return arr;
* }
